This is $Revision$ of the PC RCS support directory.
It contains extra files useful for getting RCS 5.7 (and later versions)
to run under the PC operating systems MS-DOS, OS/2 and Windows 95/NT.

Put this directory into the src\pc subdirectory of the RCS source tree,
so that this file becomes src\pc\README.

To compile, go to .. and use pc\Makefile to build.
See the pc\Makefile for compiler and target environment support.
You may stumble across some support for Borland compilers
but that is currently not supported and most certainly does NOT work.

See also ..\README, particularly the note about text_work_stdio.


Remember, this software is distributed under the GNU General Public License,
which means that normally you must distribute sources whenever you distribute
executables; see COPYING.


Credits:
  Frank Whaley of WordStar ported RCS to MS-DOS and OS/2.
  Rich Braun of Kronos contributed Novell support.
  Kai Uwe Rommel contributed many fixes and much support.
  Paul Eggert of Twin Sun integrated.


	KNOWN PROBLEMS

If you specify a filename longer than the DOS limits, RCS uses the
long filename, but DOS silently truncates it.  This can lead to
spurious differences e.g. in the filenames in Id strings, because
the filename you tell `rcsdiff' may differ from the name you told `co'.

By default, pathnames in $Header and $Source keyword expansions use /
to separate pathname components, because \ prevents these expansions
from being usefully placed into C strings.  If you prefer \ anyway,
change the definition of SLASH in conf.h to '\\'.
